# ResearchX - Decentralized Knowledge IP Registry

**Powering collaborative science and education through on-chain IP and programmable licensing**

## Overview

ResearchX is a revolutionary decentralized infrastructure that transforms academic and research content into tokenized, composable intellectual property assets. Built on Story Protocol, our platform introduces programmable licensing, automated royalties, and attribution tracking—ensuring knowledge creators retain ownership and value from their ideas.

## The Problem

The current academic publishing ecosystem is fundamentally broken:

- **Access Barriers**: Paywalled journals block knowledge from the public
- **Centralized Ownership**: Publishers often own the IP, not researchers
- **No Monetization**: Researchers rarely earn from their work
- **Licensing Complexity**: No simple licensing for teaching, AI training, or collaboration
- **Attribution Issues**: Hard to trace idea lineage or remix contributions
- **AI Exploitation**: AI labs use academic datasets without attribution or royalties


## Our Solution

ResearchX creates a decentralized registry where:

- **Academic content** (papers, datasets, textbooks) is tokenized as composable IP assets
- **Authors assign programmable licenses** (educational, AI training, commercial, open)
- **Derivative works** automatically include proper attribution
- **Royalties** from AI training, educational products, and remixes flow back to creators
- **Researchers and institutions** govern their IP through decentralized mechanisms


## How It Works

#### 1. Upload & Tokenize IP

- Research paper, dataset, or courseware is uploaded
- Metadata stored on Arweave/IPFS for decentralized access
- Content registered as IP Asset using Story Protocol's registry
- Unique on-chain IP ID generated for tracking


#### 2. Choose License Terms

- **Open License**: CC-style for free academic use (0% royalty)
- **Educational License**: Education-only with attribution (0-2% royalty)
- **Commercial License**: Full commercial rights (3-10% royalty)
- **AI Training License**: AI model training with attribution (1-5% royalty)
- **Custom License**: Programmable terms via PIL framework


#### 3. Attribution Tree

- Parent-child relationships recorded on-chain
- Derivative works automatically linked to original IP Assets
- Attribution graph maintained in Story Protocol's registry
- Immutable provenance and citation tracking


#### 4. Royalty Distribution

- Smart contracts automatically distribute payments
- Revenue flows to original creators and derivative work authors
- Transparent on-chain payment tracking
- Support for complex royalty hierarchies


## Techn Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose

## Differentiation

#### Unlike Traditional Platforms

**ArXiv/ResearchGate**

- ❌ No ownership or monetization
- ✅ True ownership, licensing, and monetization


**Google Scholar**

- ❌ Just indexing, no traceability
- ✅ On-chain traceability and attribution


**Traditional Journals**

- ❌ Publisher-controlled
- ✅ Community-governed, open remix culture


**AI Dataset Scraping**

- ❌ No attribution or royalties
- ✅ Fair, opt-in royalty-based data licensing
