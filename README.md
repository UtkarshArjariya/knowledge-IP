# 📚 Knowledge IP Registry

**A decentralized infrastructure to tokenize, license, and monetize academic & research content using Story Protocol.**

---

## 🌐 Overview

The **Knowledge IP Registry** empowers researchers, educators, and institutions to publish academic works as on-chain, composable intellectual property (IP). Built on [Story Protocol](https://www.story.foundation/), this system introduces programmable licensing, automated royalties, and attribution tracking—ensuring knowledge creators retain ownership and value from their ideas.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

- Centralized platforms lock knowledge behind paywalls.
- Researchers rarely own or profit from their IP.
- Reuse and citation are hard to trace and license.
- AI labs use academic datasets without attribution or royalties.

---

## ✅ Our Solution

A decentralized registry where:
- Academic content (papers, datasets, textbooks) is **tokenized**.
- Authors assign **programmable licenses** (e.g., educational, AI, commercial).
- Derivative works must include **automatic attribution**.
- Royalties from AI training, educational products, and remixes flow back to creators.

---

## 🔗 How It Works

1. **Upload & Tokenize IP**
   - Research paper or dataset is uploaded.
   - Metadata is stored on Arweave/IPFS.

2. **Choose a License**
   - Open (CC), education-only, commercial, or remixable.
   - Powered by **PIL (Programmable IP License)** via Story Protocol.

3. **Attribution Tree**
   - When reused or remixed, smart contracts enforce attribution lineage.

4. **Royalty Engine**
   - Usage in AI models, platforms, or content triggers royalty payments.
